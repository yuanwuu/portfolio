        overview:"This JavaScript game is a digital version of the popular dice game Farkle, where players take turns rolling six dice to score points. In this game, the player competes against a computer opponent, with the goal of reaching a randomly generated winning score first. Players can choose to roll all six dice or only some of them, trying to score points with specific combinations such as three of a kind, straights, or six of a kind. However, if a player fails to score in a turn, they FARKLE and lose all points accumulated in that round.  The game features a user-friendly interface with clear displays of the current player's score, the computer's score, and the target score. Players can easily see the dice rolls and the resulting scores for each turn.  As players progress through the game, they can track their scores over multiple rounds, striving to beat their personal bests and defeat the computer opponent. With its simple yet addictive gameplay, this JavaScript game provides a fun and entertaining challenge for players of all skill levels.",
